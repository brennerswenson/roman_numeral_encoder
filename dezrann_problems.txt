Problems due to time signature changes:
bps-01-04 : measures on the two parts are shifted, so there is a measure bar every white note instead of a black note.
bps-06-02 : there's a problem around the second repeat, for which measure numbers are shifted. But the two parts are correctly synced.
bps-06-03 : same as the previous one, problem where there are broken measures
bps-10-02 : still the same
and 11-03
and 13-04
and 18-03
and 28-03
and 29-04

Ohter issues:
bps-28-03 : ending cadenza has been cut to avoid measure length issues
bps-32-02 : this is a complete mess, almost unusable; I think it's mostly a visualization problem, but it's so hard to decipher!
