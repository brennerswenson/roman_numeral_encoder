"""
Analyse the scores to check if everything is imported correctly.
To use, run in python console followed by `s, ml, mo = f(i)` where i is the sonata number to check
s will contain the score, ml the measure lengths, and mo the measure offsets.
It is useful to run in python console because it can hold these quantities for manual analysis
and is much faster than debug mode in pycharm (orders of magnitude).

To check correctness, verify the measure lengths. If problems, find the troublesome measure and correct it in musescore.
Typical problems:
 - put each part on its own staff: select entire part then ctrl+shift+↑ (or ↓)
 - make sure that the last measure is correct both in the score and in the BPS-FH
 - remove or correct ornaments
 - check cadenzas
